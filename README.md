## 💪 Firefox is better...

### 💯 Over 100 reasons Firefox is more powerful, flexible and customisable

| Feature | Firefox | Chrome | Edge | Comment |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| History: Customise number of days to keep | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Edge and Chrome are limited to 90 days of retention only |  
| Picture-in-Picture button | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | In Chrome, you have to right click the video twice to reveal the Picture-in-Picture option |  
| Picture-in-Picture: Subtitles support | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | |
| Picture-in-Picture: full controls | ✅ |❌| ❌ | Including a progress bar, mute, fullscreen and -5/+5 sec jump. Chrome/Edge only have Play/Pause |
| Picture-in-Picture: no limits on window size | ✅ | ❌ | ❌| Edge has a limit on the PiP window size  |
| Picture-in-Picture: supported on most sites | ✅ |❌ | ❌ | Firefox supports Dailymotion, TikTok and Twitter, among many others. Edge and Chrome lack this. |
| Picture-in-Picture: multi PiP windows | ✅ |❌| ❌ |  |
| Picture-in-Picture: use arrow keys to jump forward/back | ✅ |❌| ❌ |  |
| Video player: Volume controls | ✅ | ✅  | ❌|  |
| Video player: Speed control | ✅ | ❌ | ❌|  |
| Video player: Take Snapshot feature | ✅ | ❌ | ❌|  |
| Multi Account-Containers | ✅| ❌| ❌| Lets you keep parts of your online life separated into color-coded tabs. Cookies are separated by container, allowing you to use the web with multiple accounts. While some addons/hacks/workarounds exist for Edge/Chrome, none work as well as Firefox's! | 
| Ctrl+Tab MRU tab switcher | ✅ |❌| ❌ | Allows you to use Ctrl+Tab to switch tabs in most recently used order (MRU) like Alt+Tab/Cmd+Tab in Windows/Mac. Ctrl+PgUp/PgDn can still be used to go next/previous tab too!  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38451588/168515810-84a75560-62ac-441e-be99-b539fe0966c2.png) |
| Reader View | ✅ | ⚠ |✅| Chrome's Reader feature needs to be enabled first under chrome://flags, and requires a re-launch of the browser to become available |
| Reader View: Read aloud/Text To Speech feature | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | |
| Block videos from playing automatically | ✅ | ❔| ❔ | Firefox blocks many videos from auto-playing by default |
| uBlock Origin: works best | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |  https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/uBlock-Origin-works-best-on-Firefox |
| LocalCDN: works best |✅ | ❌| ❌ | "Chromium unfortunately doesn't support all the cool features of LocalCDN." |
| Vertical tabs/Tree Style Tabs | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | Edge has this built-in, but without the heirachy or customisability of Tree Style Tabs. Half a point to Edge! | 
| Close push notifications with middle-click | ✅ | ? | ❌| Edge's notifications can only be closed by clicking the small X  |
| Tracking Protection: Blocks Fingerprinters | ✅ | ❌ | ❌|  |
| Tracking Protection: Blocks Cryptominers | ✅ | ❌ | ❌|  |
| Tracking Protection: Blocks Cross-Site Tracking Cookies | ✅ | ❌ | ❌|  |
| Tracking Protection: Blocks Tracking Content | ✅ | ❌ | ❌| Note - the Do Not Track feature is turned off by default, except for Private Windows.  |
| Tracking Protection: View stats | ✅|❌|✅ | View short and long-term blocked trackers, fingerprinters and cryptominers at about:protections. I can't find a way to view stats in Chrome |
| Tracking protection: View stats since install date | ✅|❌|❌ | This is a small thing, but Firefox shows "number of trackers blocked since <date>" |
| Developer Tools: Open immediately using F12 key | ✅ | ✅ | ❌| Edge has a welcome screen prompt - I find this annoying but others may like it. |
| Developer Tools: pop out into a separate window _easily_ | ✅ | ✅| ✅|  |
| Developer Tools inspector: Search bar | ✅ | ✅ | ⛔ | Edge is awkward about searching HTML |
| Developer Tools: show the Domain column in Network tab by default  | ✅|❌|❌| What are they trying to hide?? |
| Developer Tools: easily select multiple types, eg Font and Img | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | You have to hold down Ctrl+Click in Chrome/Edge (discovered that by accident) |
| Developer Tools: auto size column with double click |  ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |  |
| Developer Tools: live variable testing | ✅ | ? | ❌ | Firefox lets you mess with variables in the console live, without having to execute any commands! |
| Developer Tools: Edit and Resend | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | | 
| Developer Tools: Preview images | ✅ |✅ | ❌ | Hover to preview images. Chrome actually goes one better though, images are shown as thumbnails which is nice! |
| Granular customisation/configurability | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Firefox's about:config allows users to change hundreds of settings unlike edge/chrome's about:flags |
| Context Menu: Access keys  | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Firefox underlines access keys in context menus like all apps should. |
| SSL/certificate/HTTPS can be permanently excepted/stored |✅ | ❌| ❌ | On Chrome/Edge you have to choose Advanced, then Proceed each time.|
| Certificates: doesn't rely on OS's cert store |✅ |❌|❌| Firefox manages its own certificates, separate from the OS. This means it doesn't rely on OS patches/updates if certs need updating/revoking |
| Copy hyperlinked text using Alt + Left click | ✅ | ? | ❌| In Edge, the only way to do this is by Inspecting Element |
| Circumvent sites that block right-clicking | ✅ | ❌|❌| In Firefox, you can Shift + Right Click on sites that prevent you from right clicking |
| View hyperlink URL instantly on hover | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Edge (and now Chrome) force you to hover over a link for a few seconds to reveal the URL |
| Simple homepage config | ✅ | ✅ | ❌| Seriously Edge, how do I turn off all the junk?? |
| Keyboard shortcut for Dev Tools: Network tab | ✅ | ❔| ❔| Hit Ctrl+Shift+E to open dev tools: Network tab in Firefox |
| Send tab to other device function | ✅ | | | |
| Ability to use your own sync server | ✅ | ❌| ❌| Apparently it's possible! No, I haven't tried it. MS and Google are your only options with Chrome and Edge |
| Extensive customisation (eg userChrome.css) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌| |
| Multiple dictionary (spell checker) support | ✅ | ❌ | ❌| |
| Protected from spell-jacking | ✅ | ❌ | ❌| Chrome and Edge use an online spell checker, which sends your data to their servers https://geekermag.com/stop-chrome-edge-spell-check-leaking-passwords/ |
| Extensions/Add-ons on mobile | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Currently mainstream Firefox on Android supports a limited number of addons, but Firefox Nightly does not have this restriction. As for Firefox on iOS - blame Apple |
| Easy on RAM/CPU* | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | I see way too many complaints about RAM/CPU utilisation by Chrome. I'll give a point here to Edge though as it snoozes tabs and seems to handle many tabs well |
| Allows blocking WebRequests in Manifest v3 | ✅ | ❌ | ❔ | One of the most controversial changes of Chrome’s MV3 approach is the removal of blocking WebRequest, which provides a level of power and flexibility that is critical to enabling advanced privacy and content blocking features. Unfortunately, that power has also been used to harm users in a variety of ways. Chrome’s solution in MV3 was to define a more narrowly scoped API (declarativeNetRequest) as a replacement. However, this will limit the capabilities of certain types of privacy extensions without adequate replacement.|
| Android: Background media play | ✅ | ❌ | ❌| Firefox allows you to listen to a videos in the background or with the screen off! | 
| Screenshot tool built in | ✅ | ❌ | ✅| Really shouldn't need this, but on Windows the Snipping Tool and Snip & Sketch apps suck |
| Open source | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | While Chromium (the engine Chrome and Edge are based on) is open source, the rest of the browser isn't |
| Offline translation feature | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | The Firefox Translations addon (WIP) allows offline translation, without relying on Google |
| Doesn't clutter Alt+Tab dialog with browser tabs | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | This is annoying, and the setting to disable it is misleadingly in Windows' settings, not in Edge's settings (To disable, "Choose what windows appear when pressing Alt+Tab" > "Pressing Alt+Tab shows" - Select "Open Windows Only") |
| Community to request features | ✅ | ❌| ❌| Vote for, comment and suggest new features here: https://connect.mozilla.org  |
| Total cookie protection | ✅ | ❌ |❌ | https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/firefox-rolls-out-total-cookie-protection-by-default-to-all-users-worldwide/ | Ctrl+Up / Ctrl+Down to scroll to top/bottom of page | ✅| ⛔| ⛔ | Could be useful for people hard to use or non-existent Home/End keys |
| Re-open closed browser windows | ✅ | | ❌ | Use Ctrl+Shift+N. Note: in Edge, while you can re-open the site from the previously closed window, itopens in your current window instead |
| Re-open a closed Private/incognito tab | ✅ | ❔ | ❌ | This can be achieved by the standard Ctrl+Shift+T in Firefox |
| Ability to disable DRM | ✅ | ❌ | ❔ | |
| Blocks CNAME cloaking | ✅ | ❌ | ❔| https://thehackernews.com/2021/02/online-trackers-increasingly-switching.html |
| Removes tracking parameters from URLs | ✅ | ❌ | ❌| As of version 102, Firefox removes parameters from URLs automatically when these may be used to identify and track users. |
| Advanced JSON viewing | ✅ | ❌| ❌ | Edge and Chrome only show very basic info, eg ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38451588/176366232-929dde78-d5b0-4145-a964-f95fbd059762.png) compared to Firefox: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38451588/176366305-ffd45712-69a3-4e95-951e-602529f34482.png) |
| Better font/Image rendering* | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Down-scaled images are blurrier in Chromium browsers: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37906602/blurry-downscaled-images-in-chrome . Anecdotetally, people mention that fonts are sharper in Firefox, although I don't have evidence to back this up |
| Able to run portably/from USB | ✅ | | | |
| "View page source" available in context menu | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | |
| Address bar at bottom (Android) | ✅ | ? | ? | Address bar can be set to top or bottom |

| Incognito/Private mode that doesn't track you | ✅ | ❌| | Source: https://www.wired.co.uk/article/google-chrome-incognito-mode-privacy |

| View source: shows the 'raw' HTML/CSS/JS as it was sent… and highlight syntax errors in red and describes what went wrong in the tooltip | ✅ | ? | ? | |
| Sidebar |  ✅ | ❌ |❌| | Firefox includes the Sidebar which allows you to browse bookmarks, history and synced tabs while viewing a webpage. |
| Address bar: always show 'www' |✅ | ❌ | ?| Some (crappy) sites don't work without www. Chrome hides this so it looks like a "different" URL |
| Address bar: hightlight top level domain | ✅ | ❌ | ✅| Chrome makes it harder to spot deceptive sites in the address bar  |
| Address bar: "Switch to tab" using Enter |✅ | ❌ | ❌ | If you hit Enter in Chrome/Edge, they open a new tab of one you already have open (otherwise you need to use the mouse |
| Smooth scrolling | ✅ | ? | ? | You can also customise the scroll behavior on about:config |
| Tor browser based on it |✅ | ❌ | ❌| |
| Tags in bookmarks, which makes more sense than using directories. | ✅ | | | |
| Ability to override system proxy | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Firefox allows you to configure proxy settings independently of the limited Windows settings   |
| Access to a vast array of settings through about:config | ✅ | | | |
| Reader view available on mobile (Android) | ✅ | ?| ? | |
| "Switch to" option when opening a link in a new tab (Android) | ✅ | ❌ | ?| Chrome opens a new tab in the background but without any notification/option to view it immediately |
| Search for whole words (Ctrl+F) | ✅ | ❌ |❌| |
| Context menu: show extensions | ✅ | ? |❌| Edge doesn't always show ublock origin for example in context menu |
| Better SSL certificate viewer | ✅ | ❌ |❌| Firefox uses a modern, full page view that shows more info, and doesn't lock up the tab while you view the cert |
| Option to set image as desktop background |✅|❌ | ❔| |
| Choice of search engine for every search |✅|❌|❌| Firefox lets you choose an alternative search engine from the address bar ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38451588/178210218-d55806cb-2641-4baf-8b7b-82b42893b682.png) |
| Add custom search engines while browsing |✅ | ❌ | ❌| Sites that implement OpenSearch can be added as a search engine by clicking the magnifying glass with green plus icon from the address bar or search bar ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38451588/178224100-86108a71-0832-4110-aaf0-e7e3d935cf6a.png)  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38451588/178224266-bd67a94a-cec3-4e9d-86f8-fcf19987ca39.png) | 
| Search Bookmarks, Open Tabs and History from the address bar | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | In Firefox, type the ```*```, ```%``` or ```^``` symbols in the address bar to search your bookmarks, tabs and history |
| Themes: easily build your own | ✅ | ❌| ❌| Build themes [online](https://color.firefox.com/) or with the Firefox Color extension |
| Themes: utilise backgrounds/images | ✅ | ✅ |❌ | While Edge supports themes from the Chrome store, it only displays theme colours, no images |
| Themes: preview a theme without installing it  | ✅|❌|❌| |
| Themes: higher coverage/more customisable |✅|❌|❌| Firefox themes the main menu, and has many elements that can be themed |
| Themes: gallery/store is non-political |✅|❌|❌ | The Chrome web store is pushing political themes, instead of good themes (Edge shares Chrome's theme store) |
| Themes: override OS theme (eg dark/light) | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | I can't find any way to manually set dark mode for Chrome, even with addons. Edge has this feature |
| Show/hide bookmark bar easily | ✅|❌|✅| Firefox and Edge let you use Ctrl+Shift+B or right click to toggle the bookmark bar. Chrome has no easy way to disable the bar (on a new tab, for example) |
| Doesn't start/run in background | ✅|✅ |  ❌| [Startup boost keeps Edge running in the background with minimal processes, so it will start more quickly when launched.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/get-help-with-startup-boost-ebef73ed-5c72-462f-8726-512782c5e442) |
| Highest number of extensions/add-ons | ✅ |❌ |❌ | Firefox has over half a million add-ons available! | 
| Doesn't link browsing history, usage data and locations to users | ✅|❌| ✅ | ["Unlike Safari, Edge and Firefox, Chrome says it links all harvested data to devices and individuals."](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2021/03/20/stop-using-google-chrome-on-apple-iphone-12-pro-max-ipad-and-macbook-pro/) |
| Easy toolbar customisation |✅|❌|✅| Chrome doesn't allow you to customise the toolbar (at least not easily, like FF/Edge) |
| Extensive toolbar options | ✅|❌|❌| Firefox lets you add more stuff to the toolbar, eg Zoom, Full Screen and Email Link. Zoom is very handy to have |
| Easily deploy settings |✅|❌|❌ | You can drop/edit a user.js file to set most Firefox settings. I can't find a good way to export/import Chrome/Edge settings (except GPO), as they use an indecipherable file for their settings |
| Doesn't try to log you into the browser by default |✅|❌|❌| I don't remember actively logging into Edge, but it's logged me in anyways |
| Browser account that's not tied to your digital identity |✅|❌|❌| Edge and Chrome tie your browser to your google/microsoft account and can be/is used for tracking/advertising. Kinda creepy. Firefox account is purely for syncing your data. |
| Built independently of Google's Chromium browser engine | ✅|❌|❌| |
| Highlight text without any popup menus | ✅| ? |❌|  |
| Addons - keyboard shortcut to access |  ✅| ? |❌|  |
| Facebook container addon |  ✅| ❌ |❌|  |
| Dedicated search field |  ✅| ❌ |❌|  |
| Autoscroll - option to disable |  ✅| ? |❌ | This prevents middle clicks (to open link in new tab) from accidentally scrolling the page wildly if you're not 100% accurate on clicking a link |
| Native Eyedropper/color picker | ✅| ❌ | ? | |
| Add-ons: Install extension in private mode | ✅| ? |❌ | |
| Add-ons: Install extension using keyboard | ✅| ? |❌ | Firefox allows you to use Alt+A |
| Add-ons: Easily allow addon to run in private mode | ✅| ? |❌ | Firefox asks you during install. Edge doesn't ask at all, you have to manually enable after the fact |
| Mute tabs easily |  ✅| ? |❌ | |
| Visit a site directly instead of searching for it | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | When typing a local FQDN (eg on a domain), Edge and Chrome require you to add the HTTPS:// or HTTP:// prefix otherwise they search the web. Firefox goes straight to the site |
| Mute individual tabs in one click | ✅|❌ | ? | Chrome can mute entire sites, but not tabs |
| Saved Logins: Monitor and notify of breached logins | ✅| ⚠ | ❌ | Firefox alerts you if one of your saved logins had their site breached. Chrome has this feature, but it's manual and you have to sign in with your google account |
| Saved Logins: Shows icons of sites | ✅ | ? | ❌ | Firefox makes it a bit easier to identify entries |
| Sync: use any email address | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Chrome and Edge require google and Microsoft accounts exclusively to sync your data |
| Extensions: more lenient towards addons |✅ |❌|❌| Addons like [removeddit](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/removeddit) violates Chrome's web store policy, but not Firefox's addon store |
| Address bar: match history for partial words |✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Eg when typing a partial URL like "tube" instead of "youtube", Edge/Chrome does not return any matches from history and treats it like a new search. Firefox's address bar does wildcard searches and matches ANY part of a word |
| Welcome screen that's not hostile | ✅ |✅|❌| I've seen Edge's welcome screen where you have no way to close or even Alt+F4 it! |
| Notification Permissions - better UI | ✅ | ? |❌| Firefox allows you to search sites and remove all sites from sending notifications easily |
| Dark about:blank page | ✅ | ? |❌| |
| Add private/incognito browsing shortcut to taskbar | ✅ | ? |?| |
| Block cookie banners* | ✅ | ? | ❌ | [Firefox now clears these annoying cookie banners on your behalf. We’ll always hit "Reject all" if we have that option though in absence of a "Reject all" we’ll do what you’d do otherwise and hit "Accept all"](https://community.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/firefox-cookie-banner-handling/) |
| Find-as-you-type | ✅ | ❌ | ? | Hit ```/``` to enter quick find. Useful for quick searches will disappear after a few moments. |
| Quickly search for (and navigate) links |✅ | ❌ | ? | Hit ```'``` to search for links, and ```Tab``` or ```Enter``` to follow them |
| Better "Find" functionality | ✅| ❌ | ❌ | Firefox provides options like Highlight All, Match Case, Match Diactritics, Whole Words when using Find ```Ctrl```+```F``` |  
| Open APIs | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | https://0x65.dev/blog/2019-12-17/why-we-forked-firefox-and-not-chromium.html |
| Against the use of idle detection API | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |  "We are concerned about the user-surveillance, user-manipulation, and abuse of user resources potential of this API, despite the required 60 second mitigation. Additionally it seems to be an unnecessarily powerful approach for the motivating use-cases, which themselves are not even clear they are worth solving"  https://mozilla.github.io/standards-positions/#idle-detection-api |
| Address bar - ```*``` indicator for suggested favourites in drop-down | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |  Pretty sure Edge used to have this... When you start typing a URL, Edge/Chrome show suggestions (including from your favourites) but without the ```*``` indicator. Therefore you can't distinguish between your history/favourites from the address bar dropdown. |
| Context menu: "Bookmark link" option | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Weird one not to have. Vivaldi has it. Even IE has it! |
| Still supported on Windows 7/8/8.1/2012/2012R2 | ✅ | ❌ | 🟡 | Note that Edge will still get security patches (only) on these OSes til October 2023. IE is still supported as long as the OS is in support 😂 |
| PDF reader on Android* | ✅ | ❌ | ? | *Exists in Firefox Nightly, coming soon to mainstream Firefox |
| Total Cookie Protection (Android)* | ✅ |❌ | ? | Roll out has begun and will be completed mid April. Google has delayed its move from deprecating third-party cookies on Chrome — now set to roll out sometime in 2024. |
| Android app: more robust* | ✅ | ❌ |❌ | *In my testing on Android virtual machines (VMs) - both Android 7 and Android 9 . Chrome crashes often, and Edge won't even launch on either VM. Firefox runs normally | 
| Bookmarks/History | Show last visit time/date, date added, visit count fields (which are also sortable!) | | ✅ | ? | ❌ | |

## 🚮 Unnecessary Add-ons / Extensions

⚠ These extensions are either superseded, outdated, redundant, obsolete or even malicious - yet they're still being recommended online (even by Mozilla themselves!). Fake news!   ⚠

| Extension/Addon | Reason |
|-|-|
| Absolute Enable Right Click & Copy | You can bypass right-clicking restrictions by using Shift+Right Click | |
| Adblocker Ultimate / adblock / adblock plus / AdGuard AdBlocker / AdNauseum / AdBlocker for Youtube (or any non-uBlock Origin ad blocker) | [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin) is king. |
| Allow Right-Click  | You can bypass right-clicking restrictions by using Shift+Right Click | |
| au-revoir-utm | Use uBlock Origin with Legitimate URL Shortener filter list |
| Behind The Overlay / Behind The Overlay Revival | uBlock Origin's annoyances filter list sorts out most sites, otherwise you can use the uBlock Origin zapper |
| Bypass Paywalls Clean | This has been recently removed from the Addons store. You can use uBlock with the BPC filter above to replicate most functionality | |
| [DontBugMe](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dontbugme/) | No longer works | | 
| Bypass Twitter login | Deprecated by author | |
| Cookie AutoDelete | This functionality is built-in to Firefox | |
| CanvasBlocker / Smart Referrer | Obsolete due to ```privacy.resistFingerprinting``` being enabled and hardening ```XOriginPolicy``` (among other such changes) | 
| Clear Cache | You can do this manually or even use Ctrl+F5 (or developer tools) to disable cache when loading a page | 
| Clear Browsing Data | Only useful if you need a button instead of going through about:preferences#privacy |
| ClearURLs | [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin) can do this especially when you enable Adguard URL tracking protection filter in ublock Origin and subscribe to [DandelionSprout's Legitimate URL Shortener](https://subscribe.adblockplus.org/?location=https://gitlab.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/-/raw/master/LegitimateURLShortener.txt&title=DandelionSprout-URL-Shortener)  | 
| Consent-O-Matic | For most situations, using uBlock Origin with the EasyList Cookies filter will do the same thing   | 
| Clear Browsing Data | Only useful if you need to constantly and easily delete your browsing data. Otherwise, just do this within Firefox | 
| [Cycle Last Used Tabs](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/clut-cycle-last-used-tabs/) | Enable Firefox's native Ctrl+Tab MRU option instead  | 
| Custom Titlebar Text | No longer actively developed. Intended functionality has been superseded by KeePassXC-Browser add-on and KeePassXC software. |
| Decentraleyes | Discontinued, superseded by LocalCDN | NOTE: It's OK to use on Firefox Android until LocalCDN is approved  |
| Disable JavaScript | [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin) can do this |
| Disconnect | use [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin) instead |
| DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials | [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin) covers most of its feature set | 
| Enhancer for YouTube | Firefox can block autoplay, and uBlock blocks YouTube ads | 
| FastForward | uBlock Origin can do this using the ```uBlock Filters - Annoyances``` and ```AdGuard Annoyances``` lists |
| Firefox Translations | Feature has been integrated into Firefox | 
| FoxClocks | On Windows at least, you can natively add 2 additional clocks/timezones |
| Emoji addons | Most OSes can insert emojis natively, eg Win + . opens the emoji panel on Win10 and newer |
| Facebook Container | "The containers feature was introduced before ETP started isolating third-party cookies and site data by default. You only need to use containers now if you want to do things like logging in to multiple accounts on the same site at the same time." |
| Full Web Page Screenshots (FireShot) | The built-in screenshot tool should cover this | 
| GIPHY for Firefox | Most web platforms (or keyboard apps on mobile) have ways to insert GIFs. For example, Facebook Messenger and Outlook/Hotmail can do this | 
| Ghostery | uBlock Origin is more powerful and is open source unlike Ghostery. More reasons [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/72810m/ublock_origin_vs_ghostery_and_privacy_badger/)  |
| [History Cleaner](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/history-cleaner/) | You can likely achieve the same functionality using Ctrl+Shift+H (Show all history) and going from there |
| Honey | Use at your own discretion. Note the warnings about privacy ["Beware: Honey invites users to install its custom filter list in uBO without warning how it broadly disables privacy-protecting filters in uBO; i.e. google-analytics, taboola, pixel trackers, and so on. Mind this broad undermining of privacy protection if you import Honey's list."](https://twitter.com/gorhill/status/1352651716265713665) |
| HTTPS Everywhere/Smart HTTPS | Firefox has a HTTPS-Only mode built-in |
| I don't care about cookies | [This has been acquired by Avast](https://www.i-dont-care-about-cookies.eu/whats-new/acquisition/) . For most situations, using [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin) with the EasyList Cookies filter will do the same thing  | Mozilla is working on this too, and Cookie Banner Reduction is an option in Firefox for Android |
| I Still Don't Care About Cookies | For most situations, using [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin) with the EasyList Cookies filter will do the same thing | Mozilla is working on this too, and Cookie Banner Reduction is an option in Firefox for Android |
| LastTab | Appears to be completely redundant |
| NanoDefender| Discontinued, and can conflict with uBlock Origin |
| Neat URL | Use uBlock Origin with Legitimate URL Shortener filter list |
| NoScript Security Suite | Use [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin) instead |
| PDF print/save/edit addons/Adobe | Most OSes can save as (aka Print to) PDF. Firefox also supports basic PDF editing nowadays | 
| PopUpOFF | uBlock Origin can do this stuff, although you may need to enable the right filters |
| Privacy Badger | Use [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin) instead. Firefox also blocks many trackers | 
| Remove FBclid and UTM | Use uBlock Origin with Legitimate URL Shortener filter list | 
| Remove Link Tracking | Use uBlock Origin with Legitimate URL Shortener filter list  |
| Tranquility Reader | Use Firefox's Reader Mode instead |
| YouTube downloaders | youtube-dlp is better (although it's a separate application and requires some tinkering) |
| Undo Close Tab | You can use Ctrl+Shift+T (or History, Recently Closed Tabs) instead |
| Sort Bookmarks | Appears to be redundant | 
| Tab Session Manager | Firefox should be able to do most or all of what this does natively |
| [Unhook: Remove YouTube Recommended Videos Comments](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-recommended-videos/) | With minimal skills, you can achieve the same results with uBlock Origin  | 
| Simple Translate | Try [Firefox Translations](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firefox-translations/) first |
| uMatrix | [Archived by developer](https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix) | Use [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin) instead |
| Universal Bypass | Discontinued. Use [FastForward](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fastforwardteam/) instead | 
| UTM Eraser | Use uBlock Origin with Legitimate URL Shortener filter list |
| UTM Remover | Use uBlock Origin with Legitimate URL Shortener filter list |
| Zoom Page WE | Probably/unlikely needed anymore |

# Tips / Tricks

### The address bar/awesome bar
- Use Alt+D or Ctrl+L to focus the address bar
  Type '*' in the address bar to limit results to your bookmarks
  Type '^' in the address bar to limit results to your history
  Type '%' in the address bar to limit results to your open tabs

### Others
- Disable sites from hijacking the right click menu (WIP)
- Force a crash using this tool:
- If you bookmark and tag a page you want to get back to, all you have to do is type * in the address (URL bar), followed by a tag, and it'll 'suggest' the sites that share that tag. 
- How to highlight/select linked text or part of a table

## ⚙ Recommended settings

| Ctrl+Tab cycles through tabs in recently used order | ```browser.ctrlTab.sortByRecentlyUsed```=```true``` | |
| Disable autoscrolling | ```general.autoScroll``` = ```false``` | This prevents mis-middle clicks that start scrolling the page instead of opening a tab in a new window |
| Open previous windows and tabs at startup |  |  |
| Disable "Recommend extensions as you browse" | ```browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.asrouter.userprefs.cfr.addons``` = ```false``` | |
